# The 'fancy' download manager.
# This outputs a Javascript progress bar to the browser when a file is taking
# a long time to download, and hence is unsuitable for browsers without
# javascript support; also you may wish to enable it only for types/extensions
# that are usually downloaded individually, rather than embedded in a web page,
# such as executables and archives.

# Which plugin should be loaded?
plugname = 'fancy'

# Regular expression for matching user agents
# When not defined, matches all agents.
#
# 'mozilla' also matches firefox, IE, etc.
useragentregexp = 'mozilla'

# Lists of mime types and extensions to manage
# When not defined, matches everything.
# These can be enabled separately, but when both enabled,
# a request must match both lists.
#managedmimetypelist = '@DGCONFDIR@/lists/downloadmanagers/managedmimetypes'
