# Naughtyness limit
# This the limit over which the page will be blocked.  Each weighted phrase is given
# a value either positive or negative and the values added up.  Phrases to do with
# good subjects will have negative values, and bad subjects will have positive
# values.  See the weightedphraselist file for examples.
# As a guide:
# 50 is for young children,  100 for old children,  160 for young adults.
naughtynesslimit = 50



# Temporary Denied Page Bypass
# It provides a link on the denied page to bypass the ban for a few minutes.  To be
# secure it uses a random hashed secret generated at daemon startup.  You define the
# number of seconds the bypass will function for before the deny will appear again.
# To allow the link on the denied page to appear you will need to edit the template.html
# or dansguardian.pl file for your language.
# 300 = enable for 5 minutes
# 0 = disable ( defaults to 0 )
# -1 = enable but you require a seperate program to generate a valid link
bypass = 0

# Temporary Denied Page Bypass Secret Key
# Rather than generating a random key you can specify one.  It must be more than 8 chars.
# '' = generate a random one (recommended and default)
# 'Mary had a little lamb.' = an example
# '76b42abc1cd0fdcaf6e943dcbc93b826' = an example

# Disable content scanning
# If you enable this option you will disable content scanning for this group.
# Content scanning primarily is AV scanning (if enabled) but could include
# other types.
# (on|off) default = off.
