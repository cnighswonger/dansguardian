# DansGuardian filter group config file for version @PACKAGE_VERSION@


# Filter group mode
# This option determines whether members of this group have their web access
# unfiltered, filtered, or banned. This mechanism replaces the "banneduserlist"
# and "exceptionuserlist" files from previous versions.
#
# 0 = banned
# 1 = filtered
# 2 = unfiltered (exception)
#
# Only filter groups with a mode of 1 need to define phrase, URL, site, extension,
# mimetype and PICS lists; in other modes, these options are ignored to conserve
# memory.
#
# Defaults to 0 if unspecified.
# Unauthenticated users are treated as being in the first filter group.

# Naughtyness limit
# This the limit over which the page will be blocked.  Each weighted phrase is given
# a value either positive or negative and the values added up.  Phrases to do with
# good subjects will have negative values, and bad subjects will have positive
# values.  See the weightedphraselist file for examples.
# As a guide:
# 50 is for young children,  100 for old children,  160 for young adults.

# Enable PICS rating support

# Defaults to enabled
# (on | off)

# Temporary Denied Page Bypass
# It provides a link on the denied page to bypass the ban for a few minutes.  To be
# secure it uses a random hashed secret generated at daemon startup.  You define the
# number of seconds the bypass will function for before the deny will appear again.
# To allow the link on the denied page to appear you will need to edit the template.html
# or dansguardian.pl file for your language.
# 300 = enable for 5 minutes
# 0 = disable ( defaults to 0 )
# -1 = enable but you require a seperate program to generate a valid link
bypass = 0

# Temporary Denied Page Bypass Secret Key
# Rather than generating a random key you can specify one.  It must be more than 8 chars.
# '' = generate a random one (recommended and default)
# 'Mary had a little lamb.' = an example
# '76b42abc1cd0fdcaf6e943dcbc93b826' = an example

# Disable content scanning
# If you enable this option you will disable content scanning for this group.
# Content scanning primarily is AV scanning (if enabled) but could include
# other types.
# (on|off) default = off.
disablecontentscan = off

# Enable Deep URL Analysis
# When enabled, DG looks for URLs within URLs, checking against the bannedsitelist and
# bannedurllist. This can be used, for example, to block images originating from banned
# sites from appearing in Google Images search results, as the original URLs are
# embedded in the thumbnail GET requests.
# (on|off) default = off
deepurlanalysis = off

# accessdeniedaddress is the address of your web server to which the cgi
# dansguardian reporting script was copied. Only used in reporting levels 1 and 2.
#
# This webserver must be either:
#  1. Non-proxied. Either a machine on the local network, or listed as an exception
#     in your browser's proxy configuration.
#  2. Added to the exceptionsitelist. Option 1 is preferable; this option is
#     only for users using both transparent proxying and a non-local server
#     to host this script.
#
# If defined, this overrides the setting in dansguardian.conf for members of this
# filter group.
#
#accessdeniedaddress = 'http://YOURSERVER.YOURDOMAIN/cgi-bin/dansguardian.pl'

# HTML Template override
# If defined, this specifies a custom HTML template file for members of this filter
# group. This is only used in reporting level 3.
#
# The default template file path is <languagedir>/<language>/template.html
# e.g. @DGDATADIR@/languages/ukenglish/template.html when using 'ukenglish'
# language.
#
# This option generates a file path of the form <languagedir>/<language>/<htmltemplate>
# e.g. @DGDATADIR@/languages/ukenglish/custom.html
#
#htmltemplate = 'custom.html'
