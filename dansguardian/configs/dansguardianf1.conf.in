# DansGuardian filter group config file for version @PACKAGE_VERSION@


# Filter group mode
# This option determines whether members of this group have their web access
# unfiltered, filtered, or banned. This mechanism replaces the "banneduserlist"
# and "exceptionuserlist" files from previous versions.
#
# 0 = banned
# 1 = filtered
# 2 = unfiltered (exception)
#
# Only filter groups with a mode of 1 need to define phrase, URL, site, extension,
# mimetype and PICS lists; in other modes, these options are ignored to conserve
# memory.
#
# Defaults to 0 if unspecified.
# Unauthenticated users are treated as being in the first filter group.
groupmode = 1

# Naughtyness limit
# This the limit over which the page will be blocked.  Each weighted phrase is given
# a value either positive or negative and the values added up.  Phrases to do with
# good subjects will have negative values, and bad subjects will have positive
# values.  See the weightedphraselist file for examples.
# As a guide:
# 50 is for young children,  100 for old children,  160 for young adults.
naughtynesslimit = 50

# Category display threshold
# This option only applies to pages blocked by weighted phrase filtering.
# Defines the minimum score that must be accumulated within a particular
# category in order for it to show up on the block pages' category list.
# All categories under which the page scores positively will be logged; those
# that were not displayed to the user appear in brackets.
#
# -1 = display only the highest scoring category
# 0 = display all categories (default)
# > 0 = minimum score for a category to be displayed
categorydisplaythreshold = 0

# Embedded URL weighting
# When set to something greater than zero, this option causes URLs embedded within a
# page's HTML (from links, image tags, etc.) to be extracted and checked against the
# bannedsitelist and bannedurllist. Each link to a banned page causes the amount set
# here to be added to the page's weighting.
# The behaviour of this option with regards to multiple occurrences of a site/URL is
# affected by the weightedphrasemode setting.
#
# NB: Currently, this feature uses regular expressions that require the PCRE library.
# As such, it is only available if you compiled DansGuardian with '--enable-pcre=yes'.
# You can check compile-time options by running 'dansguardian -v'.
#
# Set to 0 to disable.
# Defaults to 0.
# WARNING: This option is highly CPU intensive!
embeddedurlweight = 0

# Enable PICS rating support
#
# Defaults to disabled
# (on | off)

# Temporary Denied Page Bypass
# This provides a link on the denied page to bypass the ban for a few minutes.  To be
# secure it uses a random hashed secret generated at daemon startup.  You define the
# number of seconds the bypass will function for before the deny will appear again.
# To allow the link on the denied page to appear you will need to edit the template.html
# or dansguardian.pl file for your language.
# 300 = enable for 5 minutes
# 0 = disable ( defaults to 0 )
# -1 = enable but you require a separate program/CGI to generate a valid link
bypass = 0

# Temporary Denied Page Bypass Secret Key
# Rather than generating a random key you can specify one.  It must be more than 8 chars.
# '' = generate a random one (recommended and default)
# 'Mary had a little lamb.' = an example
# '76b42abc1cd0fdcaf6e943dcbc93b826' = an example
#
# Please note: manually entered keys are converted to all lowercase before use.
#
bypasskey = ''

# Infection/Scan Error Bypass
# Similar to the 'bypass' setting, but specifically for bypassing files scanned and found
# to be infected, or files that trigger scanner errors - for example, archive types with
# recognised but unsupported compression schemes, or corrupt archives.
# The option specifies the number of seconds for which the bypass link will be valid.
# 300 = enable for 5 minutes
# 0 = disable (default)
# -1 = enable, but require a separate program/CGI to generate a valid link
infectionbypass = 0

# Infection/Scan Error Bypass Secret Key
# Same as the 'bypasskey' option, but used for infection bypass mode.
infectionbypasskey = ''

# Infection/Scan Error Bypass on Scan Errors Only
# Enable this option to allow infectionbypass links only when virus scanning fails,
# not when a file is found to contain a virus.
# on = enable (default and highly recommended)
# off = disable
infectionbypasserrorsonly = on

# Disable content scanning
# If you enable this option you will disable content scanning for this group.
# Content scanning primarily is AV scanning (if enabled) but could include
# other types.
# (on|off) default = off.
disablecontentscan = off

# Enable Deep URL Analysis
# When enabled, DG looks for URLs within URLs, checking against the bannedsitelist and
# bannedurllist. This can be used, for example, to block images originating from banned
# sites from appearing in Google Images search results, as the original URLs are
# embedded in the thumbnail GET requests.
# (on|off) default = off
deepurlanalysis = off

# accessdeniedaddress is the address of your web server to which the cgi
# dansguardian reporting script was copied. Only used in reporting levels 1 and 2.
#
# This webserver must be either:
#  1. Non-proxied. Either a machine on the local network, or listed as an exception
#     in your browser's proxy configuration.
#  2. Added to the exceptionsitelist. Option 1 is preferable; this option is
#     only for users using both transparent proxying and a non-local server
#     to host this script.
#
# If defined, this overrides the setting in dansguardian.conf for members of this
# filter group.
#
#accessdeniedaddress = 'http://YOURSERVER.YOURDOMAIN/cgi-bin/dansguardian.pl'

# HTML Template override
# If defined, this specifies a custom HTML template file for members of this filter
# group. This is only used in reporting level 3.
#
# The default template file path is <languagedir>/<language>/template.html
# e.g. @DGDATADIR@/languages/ukenglish/template.html when using 'ukenglish'
# language.
#
# This option generates a file path of the form <languagedir>/<language>/<htmltemplate>
# e.g. @DGDATADIR@/languages/ukenglish/custom.html
#
#htmltemplate = 'custom.html'
