HOW TO UPGRADE FROM AN EARLIER VERSION OF DansGuardian
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before installing the new copy, first make a backup of your existing config
files.  For example:
mv /etc/dansguardian/ /etc/dansguardian.old/

Then install the new copy.  After doing this you should copy over the old
settings by manually importing them by hand.  I.e. edit the new
dansguardian.conf file and give it the settings from the old one.  You should
also do the same for the rest of the config files.

You can usually get away with just copying back over most of the files but
the dansguardian.conf is likely to have new options so this can't be done.
The other conf files such as phrase lists are often improved but are unlikely
to have format changes between versions.

Unfortunately there is no easy way.

However as a guide the versions will tell you if there is likely to be a
conf file change.  When the a, b and c of the version (a.b.c-d) are the same
and the only change is in the d number then the difference between the two
is most likely to be only bug fixing and no other changes so you can simple
compile and replace the binary leaving the same config files in place.

If in doubt ask on the mailing list.  See http://dansguardian.org/ for a
link to it.
